--user -> Installs packages in the user's home directory (~/.local) instead of system-wide locations. This is safer in containers and doesn't require root privileges
--no-cache-dir -> Prevents pip from caching downloaded packages, reducing the final image size (important for Docker efficiency)
-r requirements.txt -> Reads and installs all packages listed in the requirements.txt file

//base image
//workdir
//install dep
//copy code
//env
//expose port
//cmd

container size - docker ps -s
image size- docker images
Check Disk Usage of All Docker Objects- docker system df
if active=0, then free up disk space = docker builder prune

curl command -> syntax = curl <URL>

Example: curl http://localhost:5000

This will: (1) Send a GET request. (2) Print the server response in terminal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 What does -f mean in curl?

-f = fail silently on HTTP errors

Official meaning (simple):If the server returns an HTTP error (4xx or 5xx), curl will exit with a non-zero status instead of printing the error page.

🔫 What is Gunicorn?

Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) = Python WSGI HTTP Server for running web applications in production.

Simple definition: Gunicorn is a production server that runs your Flask (or Django) app efficiently and safely.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENV = Environment variable that exists: (1)During build time AND at runtime (inside the running container)
Meaning: Your application can access these variables when the container runs.

ARG = Build-time variable only.
- It exists:(1) During docker build ❗(2) NOT available when container runs ❌
- ARG must be declared before it is used:
	ARG VERSION=1.0
	RUN echo $VERSION   # Works
simply, - If your app needs it while running → ENV
	- If only needed during image build → ARG
